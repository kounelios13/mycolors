To launch this file you will need a webserver.
If you have python installed you can launch a webserver in the directory you are working in with the following commands:

*  python -m SimpleHTTPServer  (Python 2.x)
*  python3 -m http.server (or if this does not work try python -m http.server)

Then you can view this page by visiting localhost:8000
